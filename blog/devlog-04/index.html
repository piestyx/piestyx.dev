I’ve been deep in the decompiler mines again recently, so Sonne by Rammstein fits naturally with the theme of coming back to the surface. Although it’s been frustrating at times it is fascinating to see how elegantly the game systems are actually built. There are a lot of interwoven mechanics in the game but they piece together so well in the back end that it was starting to make sense to me by the time I had finished.

Ah how very astute of you, clearly an avid reader of the blog.\nYes! I had indeed scratched at the surface and thought that old approach would be sufficient but as I began testing I was soon disabused of that notion as it exposed my approach to autonomous play was fundamentally flawed. There was no proper reward or reinforcement mechanism, and the AI kept falling back on default actions until it stopped entirely. And it’s no surprise given what the AI was actually working with:\n{ \"move_north\": { \"command\": \"KP_8\", \"state\": \"discovered\", \"attempts\": 1, \"successes\": 1, \"failures\": 0 }, ... } And a corresponding log:\n[13:27:59] You hit the wet glowfish for 16 damage! [13:27:59] The wet glowfish dies! [13:28:02] You pass by a watervine. [13:28:08] The giant dragonfly begins flying. ... And then told to decide what to do next.\nThere was no awareness of the bigger picture: no understanding of surrounding threats, no goal orientation, no sense of progress beyond these isolated actions. The AI was effectively blind, and at risk of being savaged by 4 furious baboons because of it.\nI needed to give the AI something closer to what a human player actually sees, the full game UI’s worth of information at each step. Which means …\nThe Richer Context Fix Humans can see and process the full game UI. For the AI to reason effectively, the exports need to match that level of detail, providing a fuller context for reasoning, risk assessment, and goal-oriented play.\nThe before and after paths\nflowchart LR A[\"Game Events + Logs\"] --\u003e|Before| B[\"message_log.txt + minimal state\"] B --\u003e|Sparse context| AI[\"LLM decides poorly\"] A --\u003e|After| C[\"Rich Context Exports\"] C --\u003e|World State + Agent State + Journal + Dialogue + Quests| AI2[\"LLM decides based on full game context\"]The context threads weaving the tapestry\ngraph TD Context[\"AI Context\"] Context --\u003e WorldState[\"World State: Zone, Entities, Weather\"] Context --\u003e AgentState[\"Agent State: Stats, Inventory, Abilities\"] Context --\u003e Journal[\"Journal\"] Context --\u003e Dialogue[\"Dialogue\"] Context --\u003e Quests[\"Quests\"] Context --\u003e Logs[\"Message Log\"]I may yet find that even more context is needed.

Have you ever been looking for something and walked into another room to find it and instantly forgotten what you were looking for?\nThis is an example of evolutionary fallibility, optimisation for constraints that no longer apply. When you’re looking for your keys and walk through from one room to the next, the act of entering that new area gives the brain a type of soft reset in cache memory. Your brain dumps the old and grabs all the new while looking for danger and threat, but because you were looking for your keys which is activating the visual parts of the brain, it got dumped. That process is one that needs to happen in the same way that C# does garbage collection, it’s just a process that also runs on meatware.\nThis matters because in my endless striving to create a more human like experience, I have given my AI the same evolutionary fallibility that we have. Imperfection is relatable. The AI shouldn’t always just be finding the most efficient path, it should reason and sometimes stumble, exhibiting intent over just computation of an answer. Relatability doesn’t come from perfection but from trying and failing in human ways. And on whether an AI can be said to show intent, reason is just intent wearing different shoes.\nNext up I need to finish the sandbox loop, wire in the reward and reinforcement mechanisms, and test how well the AI performs with its new perspective. I will also be looking to finally integrate a memory retention module with PostgreSQL as long-term memory and Redis as a short-term cache to keep latency low.\nThe blindfold’s off.
