&lt;p>“Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.” - &lt;em>Frankenstein by Mary Shelly&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Alright so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite that dramatic but the sentiment still stands. Last night was the &lt;code>event horizon&lt;/code> except I need eyes where I&amp;rsquo;m going. Damn that&amp;rsquo;s a good film, you should go watch it if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it before. The breach point was confirmed shortly after midnight when the gameplay loop ran fully &lt;strong>WITH&lt;/strong> the voice output and the avatar movement. It was surreal to see it finally all click together after debugging trace backs and rewriting the LLM logic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI, Heidegger, and Ontological Ambiguity</title><link>https://piestyx.dev/blog/blog-02/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://piestyx.dev/blog/blog-02/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bear with me on this one, we&amp;rsquo;re talking Philosophy and that means there is some German in there&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When we think of tools we are generally considering them from a specific pragmatic paradigm; &lt;strong>they are artifacts made for use&lt;/strong>. Considering from a Heideggerian perspective we can say they have a role or &lt;em>Zweck&lt;/em>, and they serve within the &lt;em>context of readiness-to-hand&lt;/em> or, &lt;strong>Zuhandensein&lt;/strong>. If we consider AI as a tool like a hammer, then we stay within that specific pragmatic paradigm and it takes on those aforementioned states of being.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My AI is a gamer</title><link>https://piestyx.dev/blog/devlog-01/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://piestyx.dev/blog/devlog-01/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="ill-move-east-to-avoid-that-dangerous-baboon">&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll move East to avoid that dangerous baboon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Update is actually a few days overdue, but the gameplay loop has now been tested and works end to end!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s grown more than I expected this module would, but that’s probably down to the way I’m splitting functions out to make it more &amp;lsquo;piestyx-logical&amp;rsquo; and easier for me to stay on top of everything. The actual runtime flow is shown in the mermaid chart below:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Basilisk Stirs...</title><link>https://piestyx.dev/blog/blog-01/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://piestyx.dev/blog/blog-01/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="python3--m-wakey_wakeypy">python3 -m .wakey_wakey.py&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>&lt;em>“I was just trying to build an AI entertainer, but, somewhere along the way I realized the AI had started helping me build itself.”&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Huh?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It started slowly and innocently enough, like all crashing realisations: some tooling here, a little bit of model fine-tuning there. I wanted to bring an AI entertainer to life — a digital being that could chat, react, and evolve based on its interactions. A fun project, maybe a little weird. Nothing cursed though for a change.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doing it with vibes</title><link>https://piestyx.dev/blog/vibes-01/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://piestyx.dev/blog/vibes-01/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="im-piestyx-and-im-a-vibe-coder">I&amp;rsquo;m piestyx, and I&amp;rsquo;m a vibe-coder&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too sure how open to be about being a dirty vibe-coder but I think it might have got a bit of a bad rep because of misplaced expectations, let me chuck my story into the ring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="from-idea-to-install">From Idea to Install&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It started in March 2025 with a curiosity about what it would take to make an AI home assistant, one that was offline and self-contained and just ever present on my network. That kind of spiraled into a vision of creating an AI entertainer that can narrate and play games with a high potential for rich and engaging lore, like &lt;a href="https://www.cavesofqud.com/">&lt;code>Caves of Qud&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">&lt;code>Dwarf Fortress&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. In theory this is all stuff that can be done, they&amp;rsquo;re pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and I figured I could just chop off a few knobbly bits to make them fit. Realistically though I have no real experience to even start to put it together, I could start to scaffold out a website&amp;hellip;maybe? But like when maths turns into the alphabet, the point languages start turning into animals it gets a bit weird and you start looking at things like Python with wonder at how this must be what aliens use for their UFOs. If it can fly a UFO it can definitely power my AI entertainer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
