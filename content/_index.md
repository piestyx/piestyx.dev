I'm building dev tools, AI pipelines, entertainment infrastructure, and learning to dance with ROCm-powered systems.

This site is where I document what I’ve tried, what I’ve built, and what I’ve learned — for myself more than anyone else. But if you find anything here useful, that’s a bonus.

### Things I’m exploring:
- Publishing and deploying with Hugo, and GitHub Actions
- Building a modular infrastructure for AI-driven personas
- Automating pipelines and workflows I used to avoid
- Interactive storytelling and real-time character synthesis
- Philosophy and AI discussions under the blog

Thanks for visiting.
