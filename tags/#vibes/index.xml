&lt;p>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too sure how open to be about being a dirty vibe-coder but I think it might have got a bit of a bad rep because of misplaced expectations, let me chuck my story into the ring.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It started in March 2025 with a curiosity about what it would take to make an AI home assistant, one that was offline and self-contained and just ever present on my network. That kind of spiraled into a vision of creating an AI entertainer that can narrate and play games with a high potential for rich and engaging lore, like &lt;a href="https://www.cavesofqud.com/">&lt;code>Caves of Qud&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">&lt;code>Dwarf Fortress&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. In theory this is all stuff that can be done, they&amp;rsquo;re pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and I figured I could just chop off a few knobbly bits to make them fit. Realistically though I have no real experience to even start to put it together, I could start to scaffold out a website&amp;hellip;maybe? But like when maths turns into the alphabet, the point languages start turning into animals it gets a bit weird and you start looking at things like Python with wonder at how this must be what aliens use for their UFOs. If it can fly a UFO it can definitely power my AI entertainer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
